# Mapping_Earthquakes

 - Overview of Ananlysis
Based on the knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, I added tectonic plate data, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and added the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data. Three colors were added to the maps. Magnitude less than 5, a magnitude greater than 5, and a magnitude greater than 6.


Results
•	Added Tectonic Plate Data
•	Added Major Earthquake Data
•	Added an Additional Map

 - Summary
All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are shown on the map when the page loads and the datasets can be switched on or off.
